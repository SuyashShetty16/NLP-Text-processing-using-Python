# NLP-Text-processing-using-Python

Please use a document of your choice (should be of one page – 350 words atleast)
Write a code in Python to achieve the following tasks:
1. Can we read this file programmatically?
2. Can we split the text line-by-line (separated by full-stop)?
3. Can we split the entire text word-by-word (separated by white space)?
4. Can we separate the list-of-words (to find out most used keywords)?
5. Can we separate the list-of-joining-words (to ignore them)?
6. Sentiments of the text – positive (pros), negative (cons) or neutral? – bag of words for this.
7. How do we create a title (suitable title for the text)?
